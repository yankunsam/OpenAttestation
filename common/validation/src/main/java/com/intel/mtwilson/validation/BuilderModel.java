/**
 * This is a convenience base class for objects that implement the Model 
 * interface. It handles Fault collection and caching of validation results.
 * 
 * The difference between BuilderModel and ObjectModel is that classes extending
 * BuilderModel may add faults at any time, and isValid() will return
 * false until the build() method is called and then it returns true if there
 * are no errors or false if there are errors.  But getFaults() can be checked
 * to see the errors SO FAR at any point even before calling build() and isValid().
 * 
 * Classes extending BuilderModel call any of the fault() methods "as they go"
 * instead of evaluating everything in a single validation method as in ObjectModel.
 * 
 * For builder objects that are reusable, a reset() method is provided to clear
 * the faults and the done flag.
